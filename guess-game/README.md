# Rust Learning Projects: Word Guessing Game
Created this simple word guessing game to learn how different conceps work
together.

There are examples of
* `struct` implementation.
* `enum` derivation for `fmt::Display` trait.
* Adding dependencies for an external crate.
* Automatic derivation of `PartialEq` trait.
* Using a lifetime identifier.
* Rethrowing errors.
* File read.
* Some terminal colours
* A lot of slightly complex pattern matching.
* A lot of closures, iterators, maps, filters, reduces.
